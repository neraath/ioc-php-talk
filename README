Introduction

The files contained in this project are a part of the
IoC in PHP presentation delivered by Chris Weldon. They
make up the basics of a sample application used to
illustrate software architecture problems and how the
Symfony Dependency Injection Framework helps to solve
the problems.

This is not meant to be a fully-working solution. The
unit tests created in subsequent branches are what help
to illustrate the possibility of a working system. However,
only component fundamentals are being illustrated in the
project, not a complete solution.
